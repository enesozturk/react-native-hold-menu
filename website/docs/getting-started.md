# React Native Hold Menu

A performant, easy to use and extensible hold to open context menu for React Native powered by Reanimated.

## Features

- Powered with Reanimated v2 🚀
- Easy to use 😊
- Dark/Light Mode 🌚
- Device orientation change
- Written in `TypeScript`.

## Installation

> This library currently written with Reanimated v2. If you use Reanimated v1 in your application, you may need waiting for next version of the Hold Menu. It is in my todo list.

```cmd
yarn add react-native-hold-menu
```

#### Dependencies

This library needs these dependencies to be installed in your project before you can use it:

```bash
yarn add react-native-reanimated@2.0.0-rc.2 react-native-gesture-handler
```
