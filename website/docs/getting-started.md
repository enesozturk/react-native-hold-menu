## Installation

> This library currently written with Reanimated v2. If you use Reanimated v1 in your application, you may need waiting for next version of the Hold Menu. It is in my todo list.

yarn add react-native-hold-menu
```

#### Dependencies

This library needs these dependencies to be installed in your project before you can use it:

```bash
yarn add react-native-reanimated@2.0.0-rc.0 react-native-gesture-handler
```
